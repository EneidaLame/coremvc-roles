Three roles are created on Stsrtup. "Admin", "Member", and "Customer". 
Also an Admin user is inserted into the Database. 

**NOTE**: ```Update-Database``` before running for the first time.

**TODO**:
1. Extend Identity User to add First and Last name.
1. Create pages to be accessed by specific roles only and add respective authorization controls.
